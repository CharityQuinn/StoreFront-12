# StoreFront-12

This project allows a user to first see products in our mock store.  The user will then be asked if they would like to buy a particular item.  Then the user will be asked how many of that product they would like. The file first checks that there is enough quantity to fulfill the order of the user.  If there is enough, the price is calculated for the user and the quantity is updated in the database. 

This project will be useful if you want to start a store or check your math abilities.  

If you have any questions, please **Slack** me a message.
I will maintain this project but it is only here with the *tremendous help from my TAs and tutor.
